# eCommerce Project using DDD, CQRS, and Mediator

Welcome to our eCommerce project! This project utilizes the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Mediator pattern to create a robust and scalable eCommerce platform.

## Introduction

Our eCommerce project aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers while ensuring maintainability and scalability for developers. By employing DDD, we focus on modeling our domain in a way that reflects real-world business concepts. CQRS helps us to segregate the responsibilities of handling commands and queries, optimizing performance and scalability. The Mediator pattern facilitates communication between various components of the system, promoting loose coupling and easier maintenance.
